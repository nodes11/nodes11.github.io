              Growing up in Poulsbo, Washington, I attended North Kitsap High School and graduated with honors in 2012. In high school I took multiple engineering focused classes which helped grow my interest in technology.

            <p class="lead">
              I am currently a junior at Washington State University working on my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I am an active member in the Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture and have worked as a Teaching Assistant, a Technical Assistant, and volunteered as the secretary of the Computer Security Group. Outside the Voiland College I have worked for the Daily Evergreen as a Developer and I currently hold the position as the Photo Editor.
