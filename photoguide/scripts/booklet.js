At the time of this photo the sun was behind the stadium, decreasing the amount of available light. Using a slower shutter speed was not an option because we wanted to capture the motion of the players. So in order to correct for this, a high ISO was used to increase the camera sensitivity to the available light. Thus permitting a faster shutter speed. Finally a large aperture was used to create a shallow depth of field in between the player and the background and to allow more light into the sensor. </p>";

Using a low ISO allows us to use a longer shutter speed and keeps the photo from looking grainy. In order to achieve the trail of the light, the shutter speed should be at least 5 seconds to capture the movement of the car through the entire frame. Finally, using a large aperture will allow the camera to take in the maximum amount of available light.</p>";
